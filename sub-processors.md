#### Last updated on: 23rd July, 2021

Particypants makes use of some third party services (sub-processors), which have access to limited personal customer data. These sub-processors support the core offering of the Particypants service.

Sub-processors provide services such as cloud infrastructure, email, file storage, analytics, user support, and payments processing.

Before engaging a sub-processor Particypants reviews the security and privacy practices of the sub-processor and if applicable takes additional steps to ensure a high standard of privacy practices.
